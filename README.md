# Reducing the lead time and error rate in KYC verification process at financial institutions
<li>Our project aims to automate the KYC process for financial institutions, namely Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs),
and Payment Aggregators, by extracting data from customer submitted documents at application stage.
<li>We aim to provide an INDUSTRY READY solution where the user uploads the required documents
<li>We are eliminating the human dependence and manual intervention for submitted documentâ€™s verification.
<li>Any anomaly noted through document verification will be informed to the user at application stage itself. 
<li>Turn around time of document verification will be reduced from days to not more than 30 seconds.
<br>

# How are we solving this problem?
<li>Using machine learning algorithms, we aim to automate processing of submitted customer personal information documents for KYC norms.
<li>Using OCR, NLP and CV technologies, meaningful data can be extracted from uploaded documents.
<li>Extracted data is processed further and matched to customer declared details through which an anomaly report is generated.
<li>Known anomalies in submitted documents are communicated on real-time basis to uploader( consumer) and financial institutions.
<li>Onus of completing KYC timely with correct documents will shift entirely to customers.
